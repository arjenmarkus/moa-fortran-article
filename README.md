Implementation of Mathematics-of-Arrays operations in Fortran, part of the article on the subject

The article "Implementing Mathematics of Arrays in Modern Fortran: Efficiency and Efficacy" published
in [Software](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/software) describes how operations on arrays as
defined in Mathematics of Arrays can be implemented in Fortran. The article includes the
results of several experiments to understand the effectiveness and efficiency. This
repository contains the source code and the result files for these experiments.

For now: placeholder

The directory `src` will contain the sources of the programs that were developed,

The directory `results` will contain the output files as were obtained with the experiments described
in the article.
